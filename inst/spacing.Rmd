```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Some thoughts about spacing.  Tidyverse lore is to include spaces
everywhere: around arithmetic operators, after commas, and around
relations such as "=" and ">=".  Now I don't think this is optimal, at
least for many of the expressions I work with.  I present below
several versions of an R expression, arranged from least spaces to
most spaces.  In general, the final version is the tidyverse approved
version.

```
1: J(2.3+0.23i,use.theta=TRUE)
2: J(2.3+0.23i, use.theta=TRUE)
3: J(2.3 + 0.23i, use.theta = TRUE)
```

Above, I prefer version `2`.  I think that `2.3+0.23i` is a unit, and
`use.theta=TRUE` is a unit.


```
1:  seq(from=1+0.7i,to=-2+1i,len=20)
2:  seq(from=1+0.7i, to=-2+1i, len=20)
3:  seq(from = 1+0.7i, to = -2+1i, len=20)
4:  seq(from = 1+0.7i, to = -2+1i, len = 20)
5:  seq(from = 1 + 0.7i, to = -2 + 1i, len = 20)
```


```
1: as.primitive(c(3+5i,2+3i))
2: as.primitive(c(3+5i, 2+3i))
3: as.primitive(c(3 + 5i, 2 + 3i))
```

Above, I prefer "2:"


```
-as.primitive(c(3+5i,2+3i),n=5)
+as.primitive(c(3+5i, 2+3i))
+as.primitive(c(3+5i, 2+3i), n = 5)
 
 ##Rounding error:
-is.primitive(c(1,1i))
+is.primitive(c(1, 1i))
 
 ## Try
- is.primitive(c(1,1.001i))
+ is.primitive(c(1, 1.001i))
```
